Description
===========

The obs_mosaic package is for interfacing data from the Mosaic II Imager
at KPNO and CTIO with the LSST Data Management. This package is still in very
preliminary stages, and should not be modified by anyone outside the Deep Lens
Survey team at UC Davis.

This package is not a part of the official LSST Data Management stack, and is
hosted by the LSST project only as a courtesy to the astronomical community.
The LSST does not commit to supporting this package, and makes no warranty
about its quality or performance.  It is licensed under the GNU Public License
version 3.

This package was created as a fork of the obs_decam package, and still contains
elements from decam. It will eventually be converted so all the pipeline tasks
and unit tests will be appropriate to the Mosaic II Imagers. Separate camera
definitions for the Mosaic cameras at KPNO and CTIO are planned.  Initially,
we plan to work with the Mosaic II images taken at KPNO for the Deep Lens Survey
between 1999 and 2005.
